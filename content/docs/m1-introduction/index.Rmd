### Change these two variables to change name of image folder and output file
#
graphics_folder <- "week-1"

### Do not change the following unless you know what you are doing
# output width
options(width = 70)
source(sprintf("%s/static/slide-setup.R", rprojroot::find_root(".Rprofile")))
graphics_path <-  sprintf("/img/%s", graphics_folder)    # Directory of where files are kept for this page

}
```

```{r, eval=F, include=F}
# Run this chunk to export to pdf
# Make sure that the setup chunk is run first
#  (to set graphics_folder and output_name)
#
#  The file is also saved before running this file

### Use this and run the lines from graphics_folder to render() to create pdf
rmarkdown::render(input = curr_file, output_file = output_name, output_dir = output_dir)

### Other notes to self
#The first 4 lines.
#```{r test, output.lines=4}
#```
#Remove the first 8 lines.
#```{r test, output.lines=-(1:8)}
#```
#From 8 to 15.
#```{r test, output.lines=8:15}
#```

# install.packages("formatR")
# collapse=TRUE #for collapsing output with code
```

#  The nature of general insurance (MW 1.1)

## General insurance

- also called **non-life**, or **property and casualty**
  - Includes: car, liability, property, workers compensation, marine, credit, legal, travel, health, ...
- for more background:
  - see [``general insurance practice``](https://actl10001.netlify.app/docs/actuarial-practice/general-insurance/) for further details about the general insurance area
  - see [``Pooling and Insurance``](https://actl10001.netlify.app/docs/actuarial-techniques/pooling-and-insurance/) for further details about the law of large numbers mechanism

## Risk components


Risk / randomness comes from different sources:

- Pure randomness (also called "process risk" or "aleatoric risk")
  - Nature of the risk
  - Can be "controlled" by volume (law of large numbers)
  $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \Pr \left[ \left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i - E[Y_i]\right| \ge \epsilon\right] = 0$$

- Model risk ("epistemic risk")  
*All models are wrong, some are useful*
  - model world $\neq$ real world
  - even if model was right, wrong parameters
  - non-stationarity

$\Longrightarrow$ we need to add a buffer to the cost of the risk transfer.

---

Insurance organises a risk transfer:

- costing of this transfer is an actuarial problem
- makes sense only because people are risk averse, unless insurance is forced: this is because the cost of insurance (the "gross premium") is always higher than the expected value


## Premium components

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{gross premium} &=& \text{pure risk premium} \\
&& + \text{risk margin} \\
&& + \text{profit margin} \\
&& - \text{financial gains on investments} \\
&& + \text{underwriting expenses} \\
&& + \text{loss adjustment expenses (LAE)} \\
&& (+ \text{taxes})
\end{eqnarray*}

This is not necessarily the premium that is charged to customers, but calculating the right hand side is one of the actuary's jobs.

# Connections with the course contents

## Modules

- We typically insure multiple risks:
  - We need to know how to aggregate them (Module 2)
  - We need distributions for counts and sums, including random sums (Modules 2, 3, and 4)
  - Those risks may not be independent (Module 5)
- We need a distribution for the losses
  - The "pure risk premium" is the expectation of the risk (Module 3)
  - The "risk margin" is typically function of the distribution of the insured loss--a quantile, or a function of variance (Modules 3 and 4)
  - Sometimes those risks can be extreme (Module 6)
- Losses arise over time, and there may be time dependencies (relationships across time) that are relevant to the modelling  
(Modules 7-10)


## R packages used in this course

The following packages are useful and should be installed and loaded on your machines: 

- `stats` is a generalist package providing statistical functions
- `MASS` ("Modern Applied Statistics with S") is a powerful package for data analysis
- `tidyverse` is a package for wrangling and preparing data for analysis
- `actuar` is a package with functions that are specific to actuarial studies;
see @DiGoPi08
- `fitdistrplus` builds on the abovementioned packages for advanced fitting features;
see @DMDu15
- [`VineCopula` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VineCopula/readme/README.html#bivariate-copula-modeling-the-bicop-family) will be used extensively in Module 5 (Copulas) 
- `evir` and `extRemes` will be used extensively in Module 6 (Extreme Value Theory);
see @GiKa16
- `xts` and `astsa` will be used extensively in Module 7--10  
(Time Series and Analysis)

---

In the lectures that follow, I will indicate which package a function comes from the first time it appears by writing `package::function`, and then will drop the `package::` part as it is not needed once you load that library.
[Note this allows you to call a specific function from a package without loading it (useful when there are package clashes).]
