Week 2
</p>

# Overview

This week, we will cover the following topics:

- End of Module 2 (Poisson decomposition, and `\((a,b)\)` family)
- Data analysis and descriptive statistics (Module 3): how do get a good sense of the properties of a data set, either graphically or numerically?
- Selected parametric claim size distributions (Module 3): what are good potential candidates for a describing the data likelihood profile with a parametric function?
- Fitting of distributions (Module 3): How do we then go about fitting the parameters to a given data set?

Here is the end of week 1 video, which introduces week 2:

\# Main references and lectures

## Module 3: Sections 1-4

Read: [`Module 3, Sections 1 to 4`](../../1-claims-modelling/m3-individual-claim-size-modelling/)

Annotate: [`slides`](../../../output/23-GIM-M3-lec.pdf)
<!-- [``annotated slides``](../../../output/22-GIM-M1-lec_a.pdf) -->

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under “Lecture Capture” ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701)). This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

# Additional preparation and resources

## Mandatory

1.  Chapter 3.1 and 3.2 of Wuthrich (2022) (for Module 3)

## Optional

1.  n/a

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

Sections 3.1-3.4 of Module 3 are in scope for the week 2 tutorials.
