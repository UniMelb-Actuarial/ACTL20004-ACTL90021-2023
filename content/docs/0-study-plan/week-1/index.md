Week 1
</p>

# Overview

This week, we will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to the course (Module 1): what are the broader questions we will answer in this subject, and how are they connected?
- Collective Risk Modelling (Module 2): how do you work out the distribution of the sum of claims if you can make assumptions about their frequency and severity, and what are typical assumptions for claims frequency?

Here is the week 1 video introduction. In this video I briefly introduce myself, the subject, and highlight some key aspect of the 2023 delivery and possible differences with previous years.

Furthermore, here is a video with detailed overview of the course resources and organisation:

# Main references and lectures

## Prerequisite knowledge

Please review the [`Prerequisite knowledge`](../../0-prerequisite-knowledge/) page for this course. This is not exhaustive by any means, but provides minimum knowledge you should be comfortable with. Note that Tutorials in Week 1 are your opportunity to ask about those topics.

## Module 1: Introduction

Read: [`Module 1: Introduction`](../../m1-introduction/)

Annotate: [`slides`](../../../output/23-GIM-M1-lec.pdf)
<!-- [``annotated slides``](../../../output/22-GIM-M1-lec_a.pdf) -->

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under ‚ÄúLecture Capture‚Äù ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701)). This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

## Module 2: Collecture Risk Modelling

Read: [`Module 2: Collective Risk Modelling`](../../1-claims-modelling/m2-collective-risk-modelling/)

Annotate: [`slides`](../../../output/23-GIM-M2-lec.pdf)
<!-- [``annotated slides``](../../../output/22-GIM-M2-lec_a.pdf) -->

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under ‚ÄúLecture Capture‚Äù ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701))
This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

# Additional preparation and resources

## Mandatory

1.  Read the [`Subject Guide`](../../0-subject-guide).
2.  As outlined [`above`](../week-1/#prerequisite-knowledge), review the mathematical background and revisions as well as associated tutorial questions.
3.  Chapter 1 of Wuthrich (2022) (for Module 1 and revisions)
4.  Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 of Wuthrich (2022) (for Module 2)

## Optional

1.  Chapter 12 of Bowers et al. (1997) (free download available from [`Readings Online`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/145406/external_tools/1188))

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

The whole of Modules 1 and 2 are in scope for the week 1 tutorials. These cover a broad range of revisions, as well as Module 2.

## Next week (week 2)

Next week, we will discuss Module 3, Sections 1 to 4.

## Additional questions

The ‚Äúadditional questions‚Äù are here for reinforcement or revision, but are not the main focus of the tutorials. Solutions for those exercises are already available.
