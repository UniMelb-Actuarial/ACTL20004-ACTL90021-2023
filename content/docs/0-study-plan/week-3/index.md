Week 3
</p>

# Overview

This week, we will cover the following topics:

- End of Section 3.4, covering the most complicated case of left-truncation and right-censoring (with parameters changing potentially with each claim)
- Model selection (Module 3): how do we assess how good a model fits to data (“goodness-of-fit”)? How do we make a choice?
- Calculating wihin layers for claim sizes (Module 3): reinsurance, and some policy tranformations (in particular, stop loss / deductibles) lead to different “layers” of claims being covered by different parties. How do we calculate the distribution (or at least moments) of who pays what?

Here is the end of week 2 video, which introduces week 3:

Read: [`Module 3, Sections 5 and 7`](../../1-claims-modelling/m3-individual-claim-size-modelling/)

Annotate: [`slides`](../../../output/23-GIM-M3-lec.pdf)
<!-- [``annotated slides``](../../../output/22-GIM-M1-lec_a.pdf) -->

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under “Lecture Capture” ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701)). This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

# Additional preparation and resources

## Mandatory

1.  Chapter 3.3 and 3.4 of Wuthrich (2022) (for Module 3)

## Optional

1.  n/a

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

Exercise 3.4.3 (Fit8R) and Sections 3.5-3.7 of Module 3 are in scope for the week 3 tutorials.

<!-- A recording will be made available at the end of the week. -->

## Next week (week 4)

Next week, we will discuss Module 4.

## Additional questions

The “additional questions” are here for reinforcement or revision, but are not the main focus of the tutorials. Solutions for those exercises are already available.

In particular this week, there are additional exercises for the out-of-scope Section 3.6.

# Preparation for assessment

## Mid-semester (15%) and final (60%) exams

<!-- install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("hadley/emo") -->

- Finalise your summary of Module 2.
- Start your summary of Module 3 as you consolidate your understanding with the exercises.

## Assignment (25%)

- Nothing to do for now.
