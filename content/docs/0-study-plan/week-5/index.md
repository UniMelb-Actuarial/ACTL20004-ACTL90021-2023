# Main references and lectures

## Module 5

Read: [`Module 5`](../../1-claims-modelling/m5-copulas)

Annotate: [`slides`](../../../output/23-GIM-M5-lec.pdf)
<!-- [``annotated slides``](../../../output/22-GIM-M1-lec_a.pdf) -->

Watch: refer to your lecture recording under ‚ÄúLecture Capture‚Äù ([`UG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824/external_tools/701)/[`PG`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864/external_tools/701)). This is where annotated slides will be made available, too.

# Additional preparation and resources

## Mandatory

1.  CS2, Unit 3 - Copulas (available from Readings Online)

## Optional

1.  Nelsen (1999) as additional resource.

# Tutorials

Note that a full list of exercises is available [`here`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801). Please let us know of any mistake or required update on [`Ed`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/5601?display=borderless).

## Pre-Tutorial work

Please study those questions **before** the tutorial.

Pre-Tutorial exercises are available in the [`Pre-Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391), which already includes solutions. It is recommended to attempt the questions *before* looking at the solutions

## Tutorial materials

Some questions have been especially selected for the tutorials. Students should review and attempt those questions ***prior to their scheduled tutorial***, after they complete the pre-tutorial work.

The [`Tutorial book`](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392) includes all questions for the whole semester already, but solutions will only be added sequentially at the end of each week, as we work our way through the set.

Note that solutions will be gradually added to that same document. Hence it is not recommended to print it, as it will regularly change (typos will also dynamically be corrected).

## This week

All of Module 5 is in scope for the week 5 tutorials.

<!-- A recording will be made available at the end of the week. -->
