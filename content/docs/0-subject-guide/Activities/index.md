# Lectures



## Lecture Times


Lectures will be delivered live, in dual mode (both on Zoom and in person) in the following venue:

- [PG] PAR-Alan Gilbert-121 (Theatre 3), Mondays, from 11.05am to 1.00pm

Notes:

- The tutorials on Friday 7 April 2022 won't run (Good Friday holiday). Students with a tutorial at another time that week will have an opportunity to do a Q&A with their tutor. Tutorial exercises for Module 6 will be covered after the mid-semester exam in Week 7.
- Note also that the contents for Week 10 are small - this is in recognition that many of you will be busy finalising your assignment the week before.
- Details about readings are available below under "Subject Resources". They can be downloaded from the Canvas [Readings Online](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/external_tools/1188).

Note this subject is one-quarter of a standard load. That means, including attendance at classes, you should be putting the equivalent of one quarter of a week’s work into this subject, i.e. 9 to 10 hours. 



## Lecture Slides and Materials

All materials are available on this website. 
<!-- on the Canvas Websites -->
<!-- https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733 [that is the community website] -->
<!-- or  -->
<!-- https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150824 [that is the ACTL30007 website] -->
<!-- or  -->
<!-- https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/150864 [that is the ACTL90020 website] -->

<!-- That being said, the best way to access files is from this website.  -->

The most salient exception are lecture recordings, with annotated slides, which are cohort specific, and which will be available with the associated recording on Echo360.

<p style="font-size:14px;color: rgb(219, 31, 62);"> Materials tagged with a `\(\maltese\)` sign are out-of-scope. They are included for your interest, but they won't be assessed. Exercises are also provided for students who are interested in learning those materials. They are however, out-of-scope for this subject in 2023. </p>

## Recorded Lectures

Audio and video recordings of lectures delivered in this subject will be made available for review. These recordings allow you to revise lectures during the semester, or to review them in preparation for the end of semester exam.

You can access recorded lectures by clicking on the "Lecture Capture" menu item on the LMS page for this subject. Recordings will be embedded in this website though under the [Weekly Study Plan section](../../0-study-plan), and will be accessible from here, provided you are logged into Canvas in the same browser.

Please note that for live classes, recordings are **not a substitute for attendance**; rather they are designed for revision. On rare occasions the recordings can fail to take place due to technical reasons. In such cases, a substitute recording will **not** be made available.



# Tutorials

## Tutorial Times

Tutorials start in week 1. Please check your timetable and the University timetable https://sws.unimelb.edu.au/2023/  for details. 
You must attend the tutorials you are enrolled in.

Tutorials will not be recorded.

<!-- For UG students, tutorial ACTL30007/U/1/SM1/T01/05 on Wednesday at 5:15pm will be recorded and made available to the whole class at the end of the week. -->

<!-- For PG students, the Friday tutorial will be recorded and made available as usual. -->


## Tutorial Details and Materials

The tutorial schedule is provided in the plan above. 

Students are requested to **complete the ["Pre-tutorial exercises"](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464391) prior to their tutorial** (note solutions are readily available). While tutors might answer questions about those at the tutorial in Q&A fashion, the **contents to be covered during tutorials are the ["Tutorial exercises"](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464392), which are more advanced and/or better suited for discussions**. Solutions to the tutorial questions are not released prior to the tutorials.

Additional (on examinable materials) and out-of-scope (on non examinable materials) exercises are also available in the ["Additional and Out-of-Scope exercises" booklet](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4464393)

For the first time of 2023, a [complete list of exercises](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173733/modules/items/4466801) with brief descriptor is available in Excel format, allowing students to filter and plan ahead (and add additional comments on their own copy if they wish). Please help us with correcting the spreadsheet - if you see any inaccuracy let us know! Thanks in advance :-)


## Private Tutoring Services

The Faculty has become increasingly concerned about the existence of a number of private tutoring services operating in Melbourne that heavily target University of Melbourne students enrolled in FBE subjects.

Students are urged to show caution and exercise their judgement if they are considering using any of these services, and to please take note of the following:

- Any claim by any of these businesses that they have a "special" or "collaborative" or "partnership" style relationship with the University or Faculty is false and misleading.
Any claim by a private tutoring service that they are in possession of, or can supply you with, forthcoming University exam or assignment questions or "insider" or "exclusive" information is also false and misleading.
- The University has no relationship whatsoever with any of these services and takes these claims very seriously as they threaten to damage the University’s reputation and undermine its independence.

It is also not appropriate for students to provide course materials (including University curricula, reading materials, exam and assignment questions and answers) to operators of these businesses for the purposes of allowing them to conduct commercial tutoring activities. Doing so may amount to misconduct and will be taken seriously. Those materials contain intellectual property owned or controlled by the University.

We encourage you to bring to the attention of Faculty staff any behaviour or activity that is not aligned with University expectations or policy as outlined above.
