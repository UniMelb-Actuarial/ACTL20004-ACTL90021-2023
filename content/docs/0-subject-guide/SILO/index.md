# Subject Intended Learning Outcomes (SILO)

To view the subject objectives and the generic skills you will develop through successful completion of this subject, please see the University Handbook.

## ACTL30007 SILO

The ACTL30007 subject intended learning outcomes (SILO) are as follows:

1.	Apply relevant pre-requisite knowledge of mathematics, probability theory and statistics in the solution of a range of practical problems.
2.	Derive and calculate probabilities for, and moments of, loss distributions both with and without simple reinsurance arrangements.
3.	Estimate the parameters of a loss distribution when data is complete or incomplete.
4.	Fit a statistical distribution to a dataset and perform goodness-of-fit tests.
5.	Construct risk models appropriate for short term insurance contracts and derive both moments and moment generating functions for aggregate claim amounts under these models with and without simple forms of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance.
6.	Derive recursion formulae and apply approximation methods to calculate aggregate claims distributions.
7.	Describe and apply copulas to model dependent risks.
8.	Apply extreme value theory in modelling the distribution of severity of loss.
9.	Describe and apply the main concepts and properties underlying the analysis of several time series models.

# Mapping to the IFoA Actuarial Statistics 2 (CS2) subject

This subject is one of three subjects covering the contents of the [“CS2 – Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis Core Principles” subject of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/curriculum_entity/curriculum_entity/8). This counts towards the [“Foundation Program” of the Australian Actuaries Institute professional curriculum and syllabus](https://actuaries.asn.au/education-program/foundation). 

In particular, ACTL30007 is meant to cover Items 1 and 2 of the CS2 syllabus. This is detailed in the following table, with mapping towards the course modules (and major reference in parentheses; see “Subject Resources” below), as well as subject intended learning outcomes (SLO).

|1.1.4  Derive the distribution and corresponding moments of the claim amounts paid by the insurer and the reinsurer in the presence of excesses (deductibles) and reinsurance. || |
|1.1.5  Estimate the parameters of a failure time or loss distribution when the data is complete, or when it is incomplete, using maximum likelihood and the method of moments. | ||

| || |
|1.2  Compound distributions and their applications in risk modelling. |Module 2 Collective Risk Modelling (MW 2) |1, 2, 5|
| | Module 4* Algorithms and Approximations for compound distributions (MW 4) | 6* |

|1.2.2  Describe the major simplifying assumptions underlying the models in 1.2.1. || |
|1.2.3  Define a compound Poisson distribution and show that the sum of independent random variables, each having a compound Poisson distribution, also has a compound Poisson distribution. | | |

|1.2.5  Repeat 1.2.4 for both the insurer and the reinsurer after the operation of simple forms of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance. |||
| || |
|1.3  Introduction to copulas. |Module 5 Copulas (CS2, Unit 3)  |1, 7|
|1.3.1  Describe how a copula can be characterised as a multivariate distribution function that is a function of the marginal distribution functions of its variates, and explain how this allows the marginal distributions to be investigated separately from the dependency between them. | | |
|1.3.2  Explain the meaning of the terms ‘dependence or concordance’, ‘upper and lower tail dependence’, and state in general terms how tail dependence can be used to help select a copula suitable for modelling particular types of risk. || |
|1.3.3  Describe the form and characteristics of the Gaussian copula and the Archimedean family of copulas. | | |
| | | |
|1.4  Introduction to extreme value theory. |Module 6 Extreme Value Theory (CS2, Unit 4) |1, 8|
|1.4.1  Recognise extreme value distributions, suitable for modelling the distribution of severity of loss and their relationships. | | |
|1.4.2  Calculate various measures of tail weight and interpret the results to compare the tail weights. || |

`\(*\)` *Module 4 (SILO 6) covers associated recursive methods and approximations. While all materials are provided as part of this subject, some are neither taught nor assessed for lack of time. Note these are not part of the syllabus.*
