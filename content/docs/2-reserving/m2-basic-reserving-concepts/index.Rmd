# Introduction

## Claims liabilities

### Definition

- Generally in insurance, premiums are collected first, before coverage is provided.   The insurer can't consider this premium as income before coverage is provided.
- Furthermore, as times goes by, the insurer does not know instantly how much losses it will have to pay (e.g., delays in notification, delays in payments)
- This gives rise to two types of liabilities:
  - **Unearned premium liability**: an amount set aside for covering losses of coverage *not yet provided*, but where a premium has already been collected;
  - **Outstanding claim liability**: an amount set aside for for covering losses corresponding to coverage that *has already been provided*, but where payments are still expected to occur.
- These take a significant proportion of an insurer's balance sheet, often multiple times its equity, as exemplified in the IAG example (forthwith)
- It is the actuary's responsibility to determine those amounts - a huge responsibility!


### The case of IAG

Insurance Australia Group is one of the largest Australian general insurers (the largest under some measures)

Its latest Balance Sheet (as at 31 December 2022), see [`page 20`](https://www.iag.com.au/sites/default/files/Documents/Results%20%26%20reports/IAGL-1H23-Financial-statements.pdf) reads

- Assets
  - Total: 34,428m (100%)
- Liabilities
  - Unearned premium liability: 7,084m (20.6%)
  - Outstanding claims liability: 13,560m (39.4%)
- Equity
  - Total: 6,819m (19.8%)

It is worth noting that IAG holds 2.01 times the APRA "Prescribed Capital Amount" (PCA), see [`F on page 12`](https://www.iag.com.au/sites/default/files/Documents/Results%20%26%20reports/IAGL-1H23-Financial-statements.pdf).

### Outstanding claims liability in Australia

APRA's [`GRS 210 (where "RS" stands for "Reporting standards")`](https://www.apra.gov.au/sites/default/files/reporting_standard_grs_210.0_g_outstanding_claims_liability_insurance_risk_charge_0.pdf) says:

*The valuation of outstanding claims liabilities for each class of business must comprise:*

(a) *a central estimate (refer below); and*
(b) *a risk margin (refer below) that relates to the inherent uncertainty in the central estimate values.*

---

Furthermore, it continues on by clarifying:

*The valuation of insurance liabilities (i.e. outstanding claims liabilities and premiums liabilities) reflects the individual circumstances of the Level 2 insurance group. In any event, the value of insurance liabilities must be the greater of a value that is:*

(a) *determined on a basis that is intended to value the insurance liabilities of the Level 2 insurance group at a 75 percent level of sufficiency; and*
(b) *the central estimate plus one half of a standard deviation above the mean for the insurance liabilities of the Level 2 insurance group.*

There's a lot more information in the document.

### Solvency capital requirements in Australia

- Additionally, solvency requirements (look for "GPS", where "PS" stands for "Prudential Standards") require insurers to hold capital corresponding (typically) to a 99.5-ile at the company's level (including diversification benefits), which require knowledge.
- This is similar in Europe with Solvency II.
- Of course, it is a little more complicated than that, but the main point is that you might need to work out the distribution of payments quite far in the tail.
