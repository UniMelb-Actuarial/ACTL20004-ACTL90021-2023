# Exposure

## General idea

Assume that we there exists $e(i)$ so that we can write

$$E[N(i,j)] \equiv e(i) \mu(j),$$
where (this is important), $\mu(j)$ does **not depend on $i$**.

- $e(i)$ will be called the **exposure** in period of occurrence $i$ (for instance, "car-years").
- $\mu(j)$ may be interpreted as **relative claim frequency** in period $j$ (per unit of exposure).
- The cumulative version
$$\frac{E[N(i,\cdot)]}{e(i)} = \mu(\cdot)$$
is the **relative frequency of claim occurence per period**.

--- 

In practice, this is not always achievable, that is,
$$\frac{E[N(i,j)]}{e(i)} = \mu(i,j),$$
with only *weak dependency* of $\mu(i,j)$ on $i$.

# IBNR claims

## Exposure based methods

### Allowing for an $i$ effect in $\mu$

Assume
$$ \mu(i,j) = f(i) v(j),$$
where $f(i)$ is some known function (otherwise determined).

We have then
$$E[N(i,j)] = e(i)f(i)v(j).$$
We will discuss how to work with this.

### Examples of $f(i)$

- A simple example could be:
$$ f(i) = \alpha + \beta i,$$
which leads to a linear adjustment across rows (periods of origin $i$) to development "base frequency" $v(j)$ (for given development period $j$).
- It is unlikely to hold across all columns without modification, so one could extend this to
$$ \mu(i,j) = f_j(i) v(j)$$
so that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will (potentially) depend on $j$ as well
- This could lead to a highly over-parametrised model.

---

- In practice, changes in "development speed" often occur in the first two development periods mostly, and in opposite direction (justifying a separate $\alpha$ and $\beta$). 
- We could then use
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu(i,0) &=& f_0(i) = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 i, \\
\mu(i,1) &=& f_1(i) = \alpha_1 + \beta_1 i, \\
\mu(i,j) &=& v(j), j=2, 3, \ldots.
\end{eqnarray*}


### Estimating $N(i,j)$

Now, assume
$$N(i,j)\sim \text{Poisson}(e(i)f(i)v(j))$$
so that (assuming independence across periods of origin)
$$N(\cdot,j)\sim \text{Poisson}\left(v(j) \sum_i e(i)f(i)\right).$$
Then we can show that
$$\hat{v}(j) = \frac{N(\cdot,j)}{\sum_i e(i)f(i)}$$
(over existing data) is a maximum likelihood, minimum variance, unbiased, consistent estimator (in short, a good one!).

---

In the end, our estimator for $E[N(i,j)]$ is
$$\widehat{E[N(i,j)]} = e(i)f(i)\left[ \sum_{j=I-i+1}^I + \sum_{j=I+1}^\infty \right] \hat{v}(j).$$

- the first $\sum$ include $\hat{v}$'s estimated from available data 
- the second $\sum$ cannot be estimated from data, and will be extrapolated from the former set (e.g. linear regression or more typically, log-linear regression as exemplified later).

### Example

@Tay00, Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 provide an example of such calculations, where $f(i)=1$.

## Normalised methods

### Motivation

- In the previous section, one hoped that claim notification rates $\mu$ (as proportions of exposure $e$ ) would consistent (constant) across periods of origin $i$, or at least approximatively or predictively so.
- There may not always exist such an exposure.
- For instance, consider Public Liability of a manufacturer of toys:
  - would time a good measure of exposure? or revenue?
  - this would unlikely to be satisfactory as the mix of business (which toys are sold and at what level) is likely to change all the time
  

  
  
### The idea

- We keep the idea of multiplicative structure, but $\mu$ would multiply something else than $e(i)$, say $\alpha(i)$:
$$ E[N(i,j)] = \alpha(i)\mu(j).$$
- We will "anchor" our prediction on a subset $S$ of existing data, say:
$$ \alpha(i) \approx \sum_{m \in S} N(i,m),$$
where $S$ is typically the first $m$ development periods for each period of origin $i$. 
- This should work well if these are deemed a good indicator of the propensity to claim in a given period $i$.

---

- Then we assume that the ratio 
$$\frac{E[N(i,j)]}{E\left[ \sum_{m \in S} N(i,m) \right]} = \frac{\alpha(i) \mu(j)}{\alpha(i)\sum_{m \in S} \mu(m)} = \frac{ \mu(j)}{\sum_{m \in S} \mu(m)},$$
which is independent of $i$, can be estimated from data and used to "complete the rectangle".
